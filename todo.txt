INSIGHTS
- window.ethereum only exists when application runs on a server, not if html file is just oppened in a browser
- await window.ethereum.enable(); before window.ethereum.request() can be sent
- jQuery a javascript library to manipulate the DOM
- access packages via two ways, either import or just run the script
    with import more precise to decide what can be included
    but we had unsolvable CORS problem
